This is a project for the completion of the course Intranet and Internet. For version 1, we will have a basic 3D model loaded up , on which we can apply a texture so that the user can manipulate it. 



So here we have to run the command "npm run" inside both these folders and we can see that we used fetch to communicate between the webapps.
